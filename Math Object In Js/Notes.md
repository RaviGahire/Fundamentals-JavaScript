# Math object In javaScript.


# Math in Javascript.

1. Addition operator ---> (+)
2. Subtraction operator ---> (-)
3. Multiplication operator ---> (*)
4. Division operator ---> (/)
5. Remainder operator ---> (%) New 
6. Exponentiation operator --->(**) New

# Properties on math object 
 1. Math.PI 
 2. Math.SQRT2
 3. MAth.E

 # Methods on math object 
 1. Math.sqrt(value) --> for square root. 
 2. Math.pow(value-1 , value-2) --> for power. 
 3. Math.floor(value) --> Math.floor() only remove the decimal numbers given value.
 4. Math.round(value)--> used for round the decimal value.
 5. Math.ceil(value)---> stretch the decimal number value to closet number.
 6. Math.random() ---> Math.random(No Value here) give us random number. its give us number between 0 to 1 but not give 1 

# Math.random generates a number between 0 and 1, that isn’t a whole number, and also isn’t 1. To get a number, for example between 0 and 10, multiply your answer by 10: Math.random() * 10 To get it to be a whole number, i.e. an integer, apply Math.floor, which rounds down to the nearest whole number: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) To get a whole number between 1 and 10, add 1 to the answer: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1) Hope that helps! I just learned this and thought it might help me if I try to explain it.


# 8 / 0 = infinity this also number in java script.and this is a also keyword in javascript
