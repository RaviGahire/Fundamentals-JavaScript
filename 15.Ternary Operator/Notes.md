What is meaning of ternary --> Ternary means three value 

Syntax  Value 1 ? value 2 : value 3

        true ?   ' ravi ' : '25' output is ravi 

---> In above syntax we used three values but out put is ravi why its give ravi in out put so 
---> explanation--> if first value/condition is true the ternary operator returns firts value and if condtion/value is false then retruns second value 25  

Example 

5 > 2 ? 'Yes' : 'No' 5 > 2 this condition is true than output is Yes
5 > 12 ? 'Yes' : 'No' 5 > 12 this condtion is false than output is No 5 not greater than 12
